# gencat_ENS_EDU WiFi Connection tool for Windows
This tool has been developed by Toni Hortal, a teacher from the Institut Terrassa.

This version has been modified to adapt to the configuration of the WiFi network of the Institut Antoni Torroja (Cervera).

## Using this tool in other schools
To adapt the tool to the data of another Catalan school, you only need to modify the dadesWiFi.txt file and verify that the name of the network in the WiFi-gencat_ENS_EDU.xml file is correct.
